## About The Project

According to an article published by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2014, they reported that 55% more students are failing from traditional lectures compared to those focusing on active learning (2014, May 12). They were interested in the failure rates for students majoring in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This project consists of designing a database to track the performance of students from those majors after receiving support. The goal is to ensure that they reach an overall success rate of 80%. Each student who did not receive a good grade on their latest homework will be assigned extra exercises. Those tasks might help them master a subject with the
possibility of improving their grade. This approach allows students toreceive personalized assistance targeting their weaknesses. 

  
Data Source:
I simulated and creating at least 100 data points.

| Table        | Number of Records |
|--------------|------------------:|
| Department   |                10 |
| Professor    |                41 |
| Student      |                95 |
| Course       |               200 |
| Quizzes      |               188 |
| Exam         |               194 |
| Takes        |               188 |
| Teaches      |               100 |
| Add.Practices|               435 |
| Registers    |               208 |
| Supervises   |              198 |

Objective: Develop a database to address this challenge on SQL.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I created the data and it consists of:

- Departments
- Professors
- Students
- Courses
- Quizzes
- Exams

<!-- Prerequisites -->
### Prerequisites

[MySQLWorkbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

Install this software to run the code.

<!-- Schema -->
### Schema
As shown below, I was able to answer the research questions using the database. This database allows tracking of students who are struggling to understand certain concepts. 
Regular statistical methods were used.

### Comments
In the future, I intend to add more complexity to this database to help universities track struggling students and support them in improving their scores. 
Additionally, I hope to find a dataset that allows me to draw more accurate conclusions
